# R_for_Analytics
Built a R Shiny App utilizing a predictive model to predict house prices in King's County Washington
Project descriptionThis project was a part of "Using R for Analytics" course at Krannert:
1. In this analysis, House Prices in King's County, Washington were predicted with a linear regression model using various continuous and categorical variables.
2. Some variables were found to be multicollinear, hence they were cured before analysis, while regression diagnostics like Cook's Distance test ( For influential observations ), Q-Q Plot, Residual Vs Fitted were run to validate model assumptions and improve the accuracy
3. From the result analysis, we found out that plot size, waterfront, number of bedrooms, grade, condition, and location were statistically significant predictors for House Price
